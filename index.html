 <p>"There's a place near Kobe where there's a mountain, and you climb the mountain, and there's a big lake near the top of it. 
We had gone on this hiking trip and climbed up the mountain, and I was so amazed â€” it was the first time I had ever experienced hiking up this mountain and seeing this big lake at the top. 
And I drew on that inspiration when we were working on the Legend of Zelda game and we were creating this grand outdoor adventure where you go through these narrowed confined spaces and come upon this great lake. 
And so it was around that time that I really began to start drawing on my experiences as a child and bringing that into game development."</p>
